# Jasmin Dilithium

Learning formal verification by implementing [Crystals Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) in Jasmin.

Work in progress.

## Notes

* Currently hard-coded at level 3
* `twiddle_factors.jazz` is auto-generated using `write_twiddle_factors.cpp`.
* EasyCrypt proofs severely outdated
* I don't know how to use CMake...
