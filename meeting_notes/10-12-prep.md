### Typo in... reference implementation??

Line 868 of [unpacking](../dilithium/ref/poly.c) the vector z looks weird.
Seeing the previous block, it should probably be +0 instead of +1.
But either would have no effects.
Similarly, line 863 has no effects.

r0 and r1 inconsistent with spec for decomp high/low bits

### technical debts

* deviations from ref impl
* code quality issues
  * badly named variables and functions
  * duct tape engineering as in `keygen_first_half`
  * any duplicate code?
  * there be dead code (at least there was some)
* long compile time
* hard-coded security level
* stack vs reg confusion and excessive moves
