# Meeting Preparation for October 13, 2021

## Technical items

### Progress Report

* Done with keygen and sign!
* Tests for [keygen](../tests/test_keygen.cpp) and [sign](../tests/test_keygen.cpp).
* Huge list of technical debts
  * deviations from the [reference C implementation](https://github.com/ethanlee515/dilithium)
    * FFT was the worst offender - now fixed.
    * Bad handling of negative quantities (or lack thereof).
    * Still not constant time.
  * code quality issues
    * badly named variables and functions
    * duct tape engineering as in `keygen_first_half`
    * any duplicate code?
    * there be dead code (at least there was some)
    * stack vs reg confusion and excessive moves
  * long compile time
  * hard-coded security level
	  
### Question about reference implementation??

Line 868 of [unpacking](../dilithium/ref/poly.c) the vector z looks weird.
Seeing the previous block, it should probably be +0 instead of +1.
But either would have no effects.
Similarly, line 863 has no effects.

r0 and r1 inconsistent with spec for decomp high/low bits


### Summary of Challenges

Here is a short list of software engineering challenges that I've mostly overcome,
albeit with some minor lingering issues.

* Unfamiliarity with assembly
	* `asmgen: not able to assemble address`
	* `asmgen: invalid instruction, check do not pass : MOV_32`
	*
          internal compilation error in function test:
	        asmgen: (compile_arg) not compatible asm_arg
          Please report at https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/issues
	    
	* Unsure what I can and cannot do.
* Register allocations
	* `error in “one-varmap” checker: modified expression`
	* Automatic variables live on the stack.
	* Adding `inline` on functions seems to help.
	* Using `fips202.jazz` still easily runs out of register.
* Long build time
	* Long iteration time - `time make keygen.s` says 1m24s.
	* Shapes a certain workflow - doesn't work sometimes. See keygen.
* Originally went by the [specification](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/data/dilithium-specification-round3-20210208.pdf)
	* Took more effort.
	* More bug-prone.
	* Writing tests is hard!

## Administrative Items

### Licensing

* Preferred licenses?
	* CC0: We lose copyright completely and irrevocably. Will we regret it one day?
	* LGPL: Seems more friendly than GPL, after having worked at startups.
* What about `fips202.jazz` from the Kyber repo?
